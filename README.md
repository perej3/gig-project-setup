# Displaying data from API with Node JS

## Description
For the task, **Axios** needs to be installed in the directory of the source files. This is so the HTTP calls can be made to the API. When the project is started with `npm start`, data will be displayed from the following API :- **swapi**.

**Postman** can also be utilised to simulate and make calls to the API that is currently being used. This helps to validate multiple things that you may be looking for, in order for your main program to successfully utilise the API.
